### Hello:grey_exclamation:

I am a software engineer living in Oakland, CA with interests in computational biology, creative coding, and sharing knowledge.

I currently work on infrastructure for genomics data analysis at [Karius Diagnostics](https://kariusdx.com).

I've been spending some free time solving [Rosalind bioinformatics problems](http://rosalind.info/users/jayrbolton/) and writing a small puzzle game in Unity involving cats.

Lately I've enjoyed programming in Rust and C!
